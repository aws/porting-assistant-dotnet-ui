### AWS UI

Porting Assistant for .NET standalone tool makes use of the newly released AWS UI design framework for UI components. AWS UI contains a collection of React components that help create intuitive, responsive, and accessible user experiences for web applications. It is available on NPM (Package manager of Node.JS).
